  <section slot="intro">
  The px-starter-kit-design module is a fork of the inuitcss <a class="actionable" href="https://github.com/inuitcss/starter-kit" target="_blank">starter-kit</a>.
  This module contains Predix Design System and inuitcss default variables and mix-ins, as well as Nicolas Gallagher’s <a class="actionable" href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css" target="_blank">Normalize.css</a>, global box-sizing, and viewport rules.
  Additionally, it includes unobtrusive helper and trump classes for use within a project, which provide utilities to help with responsiveness and spacing strategies.

  <!-- 2: Set Usage Info -->
<section slot="usage">
Use the following as a template for your sass file. Inside this template, the modules should be imported in the following order:

```
// Settings
@import "px-colors-design/_settings.colors.scss";

// Tools

// Generic
@import "px-normalize-design/_generic.normalize.scss";
@import "px-box-sizing-design/_generic.box-sizing.scss";
@import "px-helpers-design/_generic.helpers.scss";

// Base
@import "px-flexbox-design/_base.flexbox.scss";
@import "px-viewport-design/_base.viewport.scss";

// Meta

// Objects

// Component
// Your css goes in here

// Trumps
@import "px-spacing-responsive-design/_trumps.spacing-responsive.scss";
@import "px-widths-responsive-design/_trumps.widths-responsive.scss";
```

# Why the order matters

Due to the fact that Predix Design System is broken apart into lots of small, composable modules, it is important that you as the developer import modules in the correct order. That order is:

- **Settings:** Global variables, site-wide settings, config switches, etc.
- **Tools:** Site-wide mix-ins and functions.
- **Generic:** Low-specificity, far-reaching rule sets (e.g. normalize.css).
- **Base:** Un-classed HTML elements (e.g. `a`, `blockquote`, `address`).
- **Meta:** Shortcut libraries with collections of objects (e.g. meta-lists, meta-buttons).
- **Objects:** Objects, abstractions, and design patterns (e.g. `.media`).
- **Components:** Discrete, complete chunks of UI (e.g. `.carousel`).
- **Trumps:** High-specificity, very explicit selectors. Overrides and helper classes (e.g. `.hidden`).

The order of partials within each layer is fairly open; it is the sections themselves that are important to get in the correct order.

**Note:** All partials — including your own — should follow the `section.file` naming convention, e.g. `_objects.box.scss` or `_components.navbar.scss`.

# Modifying Predix CSS

The Sass is highly configurable, but **should not be edited directly**. The correct way to make changes to Predix CSS is to pass in variables **before** you `@import` the specific file. Let's take [px-defaults-design](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/css/utilities/px-defaults-design) as an example - in this file, we can see the variables `$inuit-base-font-size` and `$inuit-base-line-height`. If we want to keep these as-is, then we needn't do
anything other than `@import` the file. If we wanted to change these values to `12px` and `18px`, respectively, then we just need to pass those values in before the
`@import` statement, e.g.

    $inuit-base-font-size:   12px;
    $inuit-base-line-height: 18px;
    @import "px-defaults-design/_settings.defaults.scss";

The same goes for any Predix CSS or inuitcss module; you can configure it by predefining any of its variables immediately before the `@import`:

    $inuit-btn-background:      rgb(247,247,247);
    $inuit-btn-color:           rgb(47,47,47);
    $inuit-enable-btn--full:    true;
    @import "px-buttons-design/_objects.buttons.scss";

    $inuit-enable-layout--middle:   true;
    @import "px-layout-design/_objects.layout.scss";

    $inuit-enable-flag--rev:        true;
    $inuit-enable-flag--responsive: true;
    @import "px-flag-design/_objects.flag.scss";

This method of modifying the framework means that you don't need to edit any files directly (thus making it easier to update the framework), but also means that you're not left with huge, bloated, monolithic variables files from which
you need to configure an entire library.

# Off by default

In the interests of reducing the amount of code in your project, all of Predix CSS's module-variants are turned off by default. This gives Predix CSS two layers of reduced bloat:

1. **You only include the specific files you need**, so you're immediately starting with a very trimmed down codebase.
2. **Any variants are switched off by default**, so if you _just_ want buttons, you don't get every different size and permutation of them unless you explicitly tell Predix CSS you want them.

To turn features on, just set their switches to true (again, _before_ you `@import` the file):

    $inuit-enable-btn--full:    true;
    $inuit-enable-btn--large:   true;
    @import "px-buttons-design/_objects.buttons.scss";

# Extending Predix CSS

Two things about Predix CSS make it very extensible. Firstly, it is a framework in its truest sense; it is designed to lay an unopinionated foundation upon which _you_ do the majority of the work. Secondly, scalability is one of Predix CSS's core principles, so it is designed to get larger over time.

Extending Predix CSS is made very simple because of its very decoupled nature. As opposed to having a monolithic framework which acts as one giant black box, you can add your own functionality in and around Predix CSS code. This means that you can grow your codebase in any direction from any point. Predix CSS has some default tooling, but there's no reason you cannot create your own partials or objects that Predix CSS doesn't have.

To extend Predix CSS, simply create a partial in the `section.file` format, and `@import` it in the correct layer.
